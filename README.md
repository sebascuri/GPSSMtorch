# Stochastic Variational Inference on GP-SSM using pytorch

To run an experiment, cd yourself to the $GPSSMtorch directory and run:
```bash
python gpssm/run_experiment.py DIR_TO_CONFIG_FILE
```

See ```experiments/small_scale/config.yaml``` for the small_scale experiments config file. 
You can create your own one in the experiment section.
